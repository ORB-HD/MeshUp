animation and magic.

AUTHOR: Martin Felis <martin.felis@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de>

  * Simple definition of models (see directory models/ for examples)
	* Model serialization to and from JSON files
	* Lading of Wavefront OBJ files that can be attached to the meshes
	* Customizable frame definitions order of rotation angles
	* Loading and interpolation of keyframed animation (see sampleanimation.txt)

USAGE: meshup [model_file] [animation_file]

See meshup --help for more options.

NOTES:

Wavefront OBJ restrictions:
  - Faces of the model must be triangles
	- Textures are not supported
	- Materials are not supported

Exporting Meshes from Blender:

  When exporting meshes as Wavefront OBJ files from Blender, make sure to
	apply the following settings:
	  [X] Selection Only
		[X] Apply Modifiers
		[X] Include Edges
		[X] Include Normals
		[X] Triangulate Faces
		[X] Objects as OBJ Objects
		Forward   : -X Forward
		Up        :  Y Up
		Path Mode : Auto
  You can save these settings as "Operator Presets" to simplify the export
	in the future.
