MeshUp - A visualization tool for multi-body systems based on skeletal
animation and magic.

AUTHOR: Martin Felis <martin.felis@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de>

FEATURES:
  * Simple definition of models (see directory models/ for examples)
  * Model serialization to and from JSON files
  * Lading of Wavefront OBJ files that can be attached to the meshes
  * Customizable frame definitions order of rotation angles
  * Loading and interpolation of keyframed animation (see sampleanimation.txt)

USAGE: meshup [model_name] [animation_file]

See meshup --help for more options.

MODEL FILES

MeshUp tries to find the model file by searching for a file called
"<model_name>" or "<model_name>.json". It first checks in the local
directory "./" and "./models/". After that MeshUp checks whether the
environment variable MESHUP_PATH is set and checks for the file in
$MESHUP_PATH/ or $MESHUP_PATH/models.

Please note that as default MeshUp interprets all angular values as degree
values, not radians.

MESHES

Similar as in storing MODEL FILES, MeshUp tries to find meshes in various
places. Unlike for models, meshes are required to be in a subfolder called
"meshes/".

ANIMATION FILES

Animation files are designed so that they can be written to a comma or tab
separated file and still be read by MeshUp. There is a small number of
keywords that specify how the data is being interpreted.

There are two sections in the animation file: COLUMNS and DATA.

The COLUMNS section specifies the separate columns of the file and is
started with a line that only contains "COLUMNS:". Each following entry
that may be separated by commas or whitespaces specifies a single degree of
freedom for a frame or the time. The first entry corresponds to the first
column, the second for the second and so on.

If a column contains the time values for the frames set the entry to
"time". If a column should be ignored by MeshUp set the entry to "empty".

The mapping for joints is specified in the following syntax:
  <frame name>:<joint type>:<axis>[:<unit>]

<frame name> is the name of the frame used in the model.
<joint type> can be 
  t,translation for translational motions
  r,rotation    for rotational motions
  s,scale       for scaling motions
<axis> can be either of x,y,z for the respective axes
<unit> (optional) can be r,rad, or radian to specify that the columns
  should be interpreted as radians instead of the default degrees.

See sampleanimation.txt for an example.

NOTES:

Wavefront OBJ restrictions:
  - Faces of the model must be triangles
  - Textures are not supported
  - Materials are not supported

Exporting Meshes from Blender:

  When exporting meshes as Wavefront OBJ files from Blender, make sure to
  apply the following settings:
    [X] Selection Only
    [X] Apply Modifiers
    [X] Include Edges
    [X] Include Normals
    [X] Triangulate Faces
    [X] Objects as OBJ Objects
    Forward   : -X Forward
    Up        :  Y Up
    Path Mode : Auto
  You can save these settings as "Operator Presets" to simplify the export
  in the future.
