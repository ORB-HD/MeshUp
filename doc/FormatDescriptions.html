<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>MeshUp is a 3D visualization tool for rigid-body motions. It is based on
skeletal animation. The visualization needs three things: a model file,
meshes and an animation file. This document describes the file format for
the models for MeshUp.</p>
<h2>Models</h2>
<p>Models define a hierarchy of Frames to which geometric objects such as
spheres, boxes or a generic mesh can be attached. There is one special
Frame called BASE which is the global reference frame.</p>
<p>Between a parent and a joint frame there can be a transformation
(translation and rotation) which is called the joint frame. If the joint
frame contains no transformation the parent and child frame coincide.</p>
<p>For details see <a href="#model-format">Model Format</a>.</p>
<h2>Meshes</h2>
<p>Meshes are geometric objects thar can be created with 3d content creation
tools such as Blender, MilkShape, etc. So far MeshUp only supports the OBJ
file format to load meshes. Furthermore there are some limitations (see
README for more details).</p>
<h2>Animations</h2>
<p>Animation files contain the motion information independent of the model.
The actual data is stored in a comma separated format which allows easy
export from a simulation program and also plotting using Octave or even a
Spreadsheet program.</p>
<p>For details see <a href="#animation-files">Animation Files</a>.</p>

<h1>Model Format</h1>
<p>Models have to be specified as a specially formatted Lua table which must
be returned by the script, i.e. if the model is specified in the table
"model = { ... }" the script has to return this when loaded. Within the
returned table, MeshUp goes through the table "frames" and builds
the model from the individual Frame Information Tables (see further down
for more information about those).</p>
<p>A valid file could look like this:</p>
<pre><code>model = {
  configuration = { ... }
  frames = {
  {
    &lt;frame 1 information table&gt;
  },
  {
    &lt;frame 2 information table&gt;
  }
  }
}

return model
</code></pre>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>The configuration table describes your coordinate system. Note that in
general the coordinate system is assumed to be right-handed. The
configuration is specified using the principal axes of your global
coordinate system:</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>model = {
  configuration = {
  axis_front = { 1, 0, 0 },
  axis_up  = { 0, 0, 1 },
  axis_right = { 0, -1, 0 },
  },

  frames = {
  ...
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This defines a right-handed coordinate system for which X poits forward, Y
to the left and Z up (as seen from the model).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The table frames must contain all Frame Information Tables as a list
and individual tables must <em>not</em> be specified with a key, i.e.</p>
<pre><code>frames = {
  some_frame = {
  ...
  },
  {
  ..
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>is not possible as Lua does not retain the order of the individual
frames when an explicit key is specified.</p>
<h2>Frame Information Table</h2>
<p>The Frame Information Table is searched for values to build the skeletal
hierarchy. The following fields are used by MeshUp (everything else is ignored):</p>
<p><em>name</em> (required, type: string):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Name of the body that is being added. This name must be unique.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>parent</em> (required, type: string):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the value is "ROOT" the parent frame of this body is assumed to be
 the base coordinate system, otherwise it must be the exact same string
 as was used for the "name"-field of the parent frame.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>joint_frame</em> (optional, type: table):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the origin of the joint in the frame of the parent. It uses
 the values (if existing):</p>
<pre><code> r (3-d vector, default: (0., 0., 0.))
 E (3x3 matrix, default: identity matrix)
</code></pre>
<p>for which r is the translation and E the rotation of the joint frame.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>joint</em> (optional, type: table):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the degrees of freedom for the joint. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Revolute joint around the X-axis:</p>
<p>joint = { { 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, } }</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revolute joint around the Y-axis:</p>
<p>joint = { { 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, } }</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joint that first rotates around Y and then around X:</p>
<p>joint = { 
   { 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, },
   { 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, },
 }</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore the following 3-DoF joints are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>JointTypeEulerXYZ</li>
<li>JointTypeEulerYXZ</li>
<li>JointTypeEulerZYX</li>
<li>JointTypeTranslationXYZ</li>
</ul>
<p>which are e.g. used as:</p>
<p>joint = { "JointTypeTranslationYXZ" }
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>visuals</em> (optional, type: array of Mesh Information Tables):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specification of all meshes that are attached to the current frame.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>points</em> (optional, type: array of Point Information Tables):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Additional points that are specified relative to the frame and move with
  it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Mesh Information Table</h2>
<p>The Mesh Information Table describes the geometric mesh including its
properties such as color and dimensions and where it origin should be
placed in the current frame.</p>
<p>An example Mesh Information Table looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>HipMesh1 = {
  name = "HipMesh1",
  dimensions = { 0.25, 0.4, 0.25 },
  color = { 0.8, 0.8, 0.2},
  mesh_center = { 0, 0, 0.125 },
  src = "meshes/unit_cube.obj",
},
</code></pre>
<p>The Mesh Information Table can use the following attributes:</p>
<p><em>scale</em> (3-d vector, default:  {1., 1., 1.})</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scales the model relative to its default size. A scale of {2., 2., 2. }
 will draw the mesh twice as big as its default size. Note that dimensions
 takes precedence over scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>dimensions</em> (3-d vector, default:  {0., 0., 0.})</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scales the mesh so that its absolute size (more precisely its bounding
 box) is that of dimensions. Note that dimensions takes precedence over
 scale. Once it is unequal to {0., 0., 0.} it will be used instead of the
 definition of scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>color</em> (3-d vector, default:  {1., 1., 1.})</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The color of the mesh as red-green-blue values. Black is (0., 0., 0.)
 and white is (1., 1., 1.).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>translate</em> (3-d vector, default:  {0., 0., 0.})</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shifts the whole mesh by a given vector.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>mesh_center</em> (3-d vector, default:  {0., 0., 0.})</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shifts the whole mesh so that the center of its bounding box is at the
 position defined by mesh_center.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>rotate</em> (table, default: { axis = {1., 0., 0.}, angle = 0.})</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rotates the visual around the specified axis by the given angle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>geometry</em> (table, default: none)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A geometric object which can be specified instead of a mesh file (see
src/). Here are examples for all supported objects along with their
default properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Box Geometry:</p>
<p>geometry = {
  box = { dimensions = {1., 1., 1.} }
}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sphere Geometry:</p>
<p>geometry = {
  sphere = { radius=1., rows=16, segments=32 }
}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capsule Geometry:</p>
<p>geometry = {
   capsule = { radius=1., length=2., rows=16, segments=32 }
 }
  The capsule geometry is aligned along the Z-axis. <code>length</code>
  specifies the total length of the capsule including the rounded caps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cylinder Geometry:</p>
<p>geometry = {
   capsule = { radius=1., length=2., rows=16, segments=32 }
 }
  The cylinder geometry is aligned along the Z-axis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the attributes <em>geometry</em> and <em>src</em> are exclusive!
Furthermore the sizes and radii specified in the geometry table will be
overridden when <code>scale</code> or <code>dimensions</code> are present in the Mesh
Information Table.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>src</em> (string)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The path to the mesh file, i.e. a path to an OBJ file. If the src string
 is "mymesh.obj" it will search in the following paths from top to
 bottom:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>./mymesh.obj</code></li>
<li><code>/mymesh.obj</code></li>
<li><code>${MESHUP_PATH}/mymesh.obj</code></li>
<li><code>${INSTALL_PREFIX}/mymesh.obj</code></li>
<li><code>${INSTALL_PREFIX}/meshes/mymesh.obj</code></li>
<li><code>/usr/local/share/meshup/meshes/mymesh.obj</code></li>
<li><code>/usr/share/meshup/meshes/mymesh.obj</code></li>
</ul>
<p><code>${INSTALL_PREFIX}</code> is the install prefix specified via the CMake
variables <code>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</code>.</p>
<p>Please note that the attributes <em>geometry</em> and <em>src</em> are exclusive!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Point Information Table</h2>
<p>The Point Information Table describes a single point relative to a frame.
This point then moves together with the frame. The point is optionally
drawn with a line from the frame's origin to the location of the point.</p>
<p>An example Point Information Table looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>ToolCenterPoint = {
    coordinates = { 0.25, 0.1, 0.5 },
    color = { 0.8, 0.8, 0.2},
    draw_line = true,
  },
</code></pre>
<p>The Point Information Table has the following attributes:</p>
<p><em>coordinates</em> (3-d vector)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These are the coordinates of the point in the frame in which the point is
 defined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>color</em> (3-d vector, default:  {1., 1., 1.})</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The color of the mesh as red-green-blue values. Black is (0., 0., 0.)
 and white is (1., 1., 1.).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>draw_line</em> (boolean, default:  false)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies whether a line from the frame origin to the point should be
 drawn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>line_width</em> (number, default:  1.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the width of the line in pixels. Note that the width range
 may be limited by the graphics hardware and/or driver. (Added in v0.3.14)</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Animation Files</h1>
<p>Animation files are designed so that they can be written to a comma
separated file and still be read by MeshUp. The first column must always be
the time. Any intermediate values are computed by meshup using
interpolation.</p>
<p>All other columns (referred to as data columns) are interpreted as
translations, rotations, or scalings of the model frames. MeshUp can be
instructed to interpret the data columns in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the degrees of freedom descriptions of the joints in the Frame
Information Table</li>
<li>Describe the type of transformations using a special header in the
animation file</li>
</ol>
<p>The latter has always precedence.</p>
<h2>Transformation Description in the Animation File</h2>
<p>There is a small number of keywords that specify how the data is being
interpreted. There are two sections in the animation file: COLUMNS and
DATA.</p>
<h3>COLUMNS section</h3>
<p>The COLUMNS section specifies the separate columns of the file and is
started with a line that only contains "COLUMNS:". Each following entry
that may be separated by commas or whitespaces specifies a single degree of
freedom for a frame or the time. The first entry corresponds to the first
column, the second for the second and so on.</p>
<p>The first column must always be "time". If a column should be
ignored by MeshUp set the entry to "empty".</p>
<p>The mapping for joints is specified in the following syntax:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;frame name&gt;:&lt;joint type&gt;:&lt;axis&gt;[:&lt;unit&gt;]
</code></pre>
<p>where</p>
<pre><code>&lt;frame name&gt; is the name of the frame used in the model.
&lt;joint type&gt; can be 
  t,translation for translational motions
  r,rotation for rotational motions
  s,scale for scaling motions
&lt;axis&gt; can be either of x,y,z for the respective axes. Negative axes can
  be specified by prepending a '-' to the axis name.
&lt;unit&gt; (optional) can be r,rad, or radian to specify that the columns
  should be interpreted as radians instead of the default degrees.
</code></pre>
<p>For a single frame all column specifications must be consecutive in the
COLUMN section.</p>
<h3>DATA section</h3>
<p>The <code>DATA</code> section has to be specified as multi-column data of the raw values
for which each column is separated by a "," (comma) and at least one
whitespace (space or tab).</p>
<h4>DATA_FROM</h4>
<p>The section either starts with <code>DATA:</code> and directly after it the data or
alternatively, one can use <code>DATA_FROM: &lt;some/path/to/filename.cs&gt;</code> to load the
actual data from another data file. This can be useful when wanting to keep
the actual data as a clear .csv file or if one wants to re-use the header
of a file.</p>
<p>By default DATA_FROM will load the data file from the same
directory as the original file. However if the file should be loaded from
n absolute path you must start the path with a "/", e.g. <code>DATA_FROM:
/some/absolute/path/data.csv</code>.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Meshup comes with a set of example files, e.g. see sampleanimation.txt for
an example.</p>
